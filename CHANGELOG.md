## 0.1.4

### Added
- **Web/WASM Stubs:** Added `includes_stub.dart` and `io_stub.dart` to safely
  throw `UnsupportedError` on non-IO platforms. The package now loads cleanly
  in Flutter Web / WASM projects (core parsing remains available).

### Changed
- **Barrel Exports:** Simplified conditional exports â€” the full units for
  `io.dart` and `includes.dart` are exported so that all extensions are
  visible on IO platforms.
- **README & Example:** Updated to use the recommended path-based helpers:
  `parseFlatFile`, `parseFlatFileSync`, `parseFileWithIncludes`,
  `writeFlat`, `writeFlatSync` (no more `src/` imports).
  File-based extensions remain available as ergonomic sugar.

### Fixed
- Pub.dev analysis warning: Missing `lints` dependency in `example/` package.
- Web/WASM analysis: no longer fails due to missing `dart:io` references.

### Notes
- This release is **non-breaking** (`0.1.x` â†’ `0.1.4`).

## 0.1.3

Added:
- Added full support for *recursive* `config-file` *includes* (Ghostty-compatible).
  - Supports optional includes (`?path`), nested includes, relative paths, and cycle detection.
  - Defensive maximum include depth (`maxIncludeDepth`, default 64).
  - Async/sync I/O via `File.parseWithIncludes()` and `parseFileWithIncludes()`.
- Introduced example and documentation for *null-reset semantics* (`key = â†’ null`, blocks later assignments).
- Clarified behavior for *one include per line* â€” comma-separated paths are treated as a single literal.
- Improved README with clear *include semantics*, usage examples, and quote-awareness notes (`getMap()` vs `getDocument()`).

Improved:
- Internal include handling now normalizes paths and detects circular dependencies more robustly.
- Minor parser cleanups and docstring refinements for consistency.

## 0.1.2

Documentation & metadata improvements
- Updated dependency constraints and topics for pub.dev
- Updated README with slightly clearer description

## 0.1.1

Added:
- `FlatEntry.validated` factory for safe key creation
- Strict factories (`fromMap`, `fromEntries`, `merge`, `single`) with `strict` toggle
- Updated README with validation and factory examples

Improved:
- Internal key validation logic
- Documentation clarity and formatting
