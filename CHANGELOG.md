# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Added:

- Deep flattening via `FlatConfig.fromMapData()`.
- `FlatMapDataOptions` for list mode, CSV encoding, null handling, key escaping.
- RFC-4180 CSV utilities (`rfc4180Quote`, `rfc4180CsvItemEncoder`).
- `keyEscaper` for safe nested key handling.
- New tests: full coverage for map flattening, list modes, and CSV quoting.

Improved:

- Documentation and README examples for `fromMapData` and document factories.
- Barrel exports (`flatconfig.dart`) now include all public constructors.
- Internal structure cleanup and error context clarity.

Fixed:

- Proper key escaping on root keys in `fromMapData`.
- Accurate multi-value list flattening order.

## 0.2.0

Added:

- Generic & context-aware accessors:
  - `getAs<T>(key, converter)` ‚Äì lenient ‚Äútry‚Äù variant; returns `null` on missing/empty/invalid.
  - `getAsOr<T>(key, converter, default)` ‚Äì lenient with fallback.
  - `requireAs<T>(key, converter)` ‚Äì strict; throws `FormatException` with context.
  - `getAsWith<T>(key, (raw, key, doc) => T?)` ‚Äì advanced, document-aware converter.
  - `requireAsWith<T>(...)` ‚Äì strict variant for advanced converters.
  - `getAllAs<T>(key, converter)` ‚Äì lazy, lenient conversion for duplicate keys.
  - `requireAllAs<T>(key, converter)` ‚Äì strict conversion for all values.
- README: New **Custom Converters** section with examples.
- README: **Comparison to INI/TOML** and **Design Philosophy** sections.

Improved:

- Consistent, idiomatic error semantics:
  - Lenient `get*` accessors never throw; strict `require*` accessors throw with `.explain(key, got, cause)` context.

Notes:

- No breaking changes. Web/WASM-safe core remains unchanged; I/O helpers are still VM-only.

## 0.1.4

Added:

- **Web/WASM Stubs:** Added `includes_stub.dart` and `io_stub.dart` to safely
  throw `UnsupportedError` on non-IO platforms. The package now loads cleanly
  in Flutter Web / WASM projects (core parsing remains available).

Changed:

- **Barrel Exports:** Simplified conditional exports ‚Äî the full units for
  `io.dart` and `includes.dart` are exported so that all extensions are
  visible on IO platforms.
- **README & Example:** Updated to use the recommended path-based helpers:
  `parseFlatFile`, `parseFlatFileSync`, `parseFileWithIncludes`,
  `writeFlat`, `writeFlatSync` (no more `src/` imports).
  File-based extensions remain available as ergonomic sugar.

Fixed:

- Pub.dev analysis warning: Missing `lints` dependency in `example/` package.
- Web/WASM analysis: no longer fails due to missing `dart:io` references.

Notes:

- This release is **non-breaking** (`0.1.x` ‚Üí `0.1.4`).

## 0.1.3

Added:

- Added full support for *recursive* `config-file` *includes* (Ghostty-compatible).
  - Supports optional includes (`?path`), nested includes, relative paths, and cycle detection.
  - Defensive maximum include depth (`maxIncludeDepth`, default 64).
  - Async/sync I/O via `File.parseWithIncludes()` and `parseFileWithIncludes()`.
- Introduced example and documentation for *null-reset semantics* (`key = ‚Üí null`, blocks later assignments).
- Clarified behavior for *one include per line* ‚Äî comma-separated paths are treated as a single literal.
- Improved README with clear *include semantics*, usage examples, and quote-awareness notes (`getMap()` vs `getDocument()`).

Improved:

- Internal include handling now normalizes paths and detects circular dependencies more robustly.
- Minor parser cleanups and docstring refinements for consistency.

## 0.1.2

Documentation & metadata improvements:

- Updated dependency constraints and topics for pub.dev
- Updated README with slightly clearer description

## 0.1.1

Added:

- `FlatEntry.validated` factory for safe key creation
- Strict factories (`fromMap`, `fromEntries`, `merge`, `single`) with `strict` toggle
- Updated README with validation and factory examples

Improved:

- Internal key validation logic
- Documentation clarity and formatting

## 0.1.0
