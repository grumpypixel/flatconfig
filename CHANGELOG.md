## 0.1.3

Added:
- Added full support for *recursive* `config-file` *includes* (Ghostty-compatible).
  - Supports optional includes (`?path`), nested includes, relative paths, and cycle detection.
  - Defensive maximum include depth (`maxIncludeDepth`, default 64).
  - Async/sync I/O via `File.parseWithIncludes()` and `parseFileWithIncludes()`.
- Introduced example and documentation for *null-reset semantics* (`key = â†’ null`, blocks later assignments).
- Clarified behavior for *one include per line* â€” comma-separated paths are treated as a single literal.
- Improved README with clear *include semantics*, usage examples, and quote-awareness notes (`getMap()` vs `getDocument()`).

Improved:
- Internal include handling now normalizes paths and detects circular dependencies more robustly.
- Minor parser cleanups and docstring refinements for consistency.
